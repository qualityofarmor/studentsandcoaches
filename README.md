# studentsandcoaches

Requirements (paraphrased):
* There's two main models here, Coaches and Students.
* A coach can be assigned several students.
* We're talkin' about several coaches and each must be capable of managing
  several students. In the interest of work/life balance, that student list must
  be distributed evenly between the coaching staff.
* The distribution is dependent on the size of each Coach's current student pool
  and the coaches with the least amount of students are the first to be assigned
  students.
